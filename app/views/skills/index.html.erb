        About this guy....
      </p>
      <div>
        And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life
        isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .... And I'm not
        perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.
        It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I
        don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was
        his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major
        League. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to
        go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
        embarrass them in the process.

        Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight
        on with that one and just dispelled that one. And you know, I'm tired ...
        I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just
        winning every second .... And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just
        delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. But like in baseball, the
        scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
        heart ... of the hearts.
